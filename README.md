<h1> Exploring Prompt Patterns in AI-Assisted Code Generation </h1>
This project analyzes different prompt patterns in AI-assisted code generation to optimize developer-AI interactions. By evaluating 20,000+ AI-generated code responses, we identify the most effective prompting 
strategies that yield high-quality outputs with minimal interactions.

<h3> Tech Stack </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Python (Data processing, analysis)</li>  
  <li> Pandas, NumPy (Data handling) </li>
  <li> TextBlob (Sentiment analysis) </li>
  <li> Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)</li>
</ul>
<h3> Key Features </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Assessed 7 Developer GPT Prompt Patterns to enhance AI-generated code quality.</li>
  <li> Automated classification of 20,000 AI-generated code responses using keyword algorithms.<br><i>{Citation: S. Dicuffa. Ssw625. https://github.com/sophiadicuffa/SSW625, 2024.GitHub Repository.}</i></li>
  <li> Computed effectiveness scores based on response length, token ratio, and sentiment analysis.</li>
  <li> Identified the most efficient prompt structures that improve AI interaction and reduce iterative corrections.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Results </h3>
<ul>
  <li> "Context and Instruction" & "Recipe" patterns were found to be the most effective.</li>
  <li> Structured prompts reduced iterative interactions by 50%, improving developer productivity.</li>
  <li> The study provides insights into optimal prompt engineering strategies for AI-assisted coding.</li>
</ul>
